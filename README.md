My first ever game, Jumpy Run, is a 3D side-scroller that plays like an easy-mode Floppy Birds.

I developed the first playable prototype in an evening after downloading the Unity game engine on a whim.

Over the next day, I polished the gameplay, added a main menu, scoring and uploaded the release.

**Play the game [Here](ooyendyk.github.io/jumpy-run)**

Or download the game [here](https://github.com/ooyendyk/jumpy-run/releases)


If work on this project clone the repository and open it in Unity.
